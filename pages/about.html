                <h2 class="text-green__dark">Sorsogon City Profile</h2>
                <p>The City of Sorsogon was created by virtue of Republic Act 8806,
                which was signed into law on August 16, 2000 and ratified during a
                plebiscite on December 16, 2000. RA 8806, also known as the
                Cityhood Law, called for the merger of the municipalities of
                Sorsogon and Bacon into a component city of the Province of
                Sorsogon. Sorsogon thus, functioned as a full-pledged city on June
                30, 2001, with the assumption into office of the first city
                officials.</p>
                <h2 class="text-green__dark">Brief History</h2>
                <p>Although relatively young, the city boasts of a colorful history
                that goes back to the pre-Hispanic times, when Moro pirates
                frequently trespassed its territorial waters. With the coming of
                the Spanish colonizers in the 1600s, Bacon was organized into a
                visita of the town of Casiguran, one of the oldest settlements in
                Luzon. The municipality of Sorsogon, whose original Site was in
                Sitio Pocdol in Capuy, was in turn, a visita of Bacon. As its
                population increased, however, Sorsogon was declared an
                independent, full-fledged parish in 1628.</p>
                <p>The Pueblo Civil de Bacon was established in 1754, with Juan Elias
                as its first gobernadorcillo. Sorsogon on the other hand, became
                an independent political unit in 1864.</p>
                <p>From their organization as visitas and eventually as independent
                pueblos, both Bacon and Sorsogon remained under the territorial
                jurisdiction of the province of Albay. On October 17, 1894, the
                Spanish authorities organized a geographical unit independent from
                Albay, with the town of Sorsogon as its seat of government. The
                new province adopted the name of the town and has since been known
                as the Province of Sorsogon.</p>
                <p>Before the merger to form the City of Sorsogon, Bacon and Sorsogon
                enjoyed different economic classifications, with Sorsogon
                classified as first-class municipality and Bacon, fourth class.
                The merger has resulted in a political unit composed of 64
                barangays falling into three districts: Bacon (with 28 barangays),
                Sorsogon West (with 22 barangays) and Sorsogon East (with 14
                barangays).</p><br>
